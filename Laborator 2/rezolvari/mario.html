        <h1>Super Mario Brothers</h1>
        Super Mario Bros is a platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). 
        The successor to the 1983 arcade game Mario Bros and the first game in the Super Mario series, it was first released in 1985 for the Famicom in Japan. 
        <br> <br>
        The game was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka as "a grand culmination" of the Famicom team's three years of game 
        mechanics and programming, drawing from their experiences working on Devil World and the side-scrollers Excitebike and Kung Fu.

                Players control Mario, or his brother Luigi in the multiplayer mode, as they traverse the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess 
                Toadstool from King Koopa (later named Bowser). They traverse side-scrolling stages while avoiding hazards such as enemies and 
                pits with the aid of power-ups such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Starman.
